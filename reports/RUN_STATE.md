notes:
- Preconditions verified: clean tree, up to date with origin/codex/book-development at 3cfa879; 001–003 provisionally_accepted; settled-through 003 in state and ledger; check and 29 tests pass.
- Planner also fixed tests/test_story.py: the fixture copied only briefs 001–003, so any new registry entry broke 12 tests; it now copies every brief the registry lists. Mechanical; for the morning report.
